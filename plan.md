# Detailed Implementation Plan for Rice Export Website UI

This plan outlines the creation of a modern, multi‑page rice export website using Next.js with Tailwind CSS. It details each file modification and the creation of new components with proper error handling and clean UI design.

---

## 1. Global Layout and Styling

**File: src/app/layout.tsx**  
- Create (or update) the root layout component that wraps all pages with a responsive container (e.g., using "min-h-screen flex flex-col").  
- Import and include the new Header and Footer components.  
- Ensure global Tailwind CSS is applied (already managed via globals.css).  
- Optionally add meta tags and error boundaries for global error handling.

---

## 2. Home Page (Landing Page)

**File: src/app/page.tsx**  
- Build a hero section with a bold headline such as “Welcome to Rice Export Limited” and a descriptive tagline.  
- Include a prominent `<img>` element using:  
  `src="https://placehold.co/1920x1080?text=Vibrant+rice+fields+in+lush+green+landscape+during+harvest+time"`  
  with a detailed descriptive alt text; add an `onError` handler to provide a fallback style.  
- Add a clear call-to-action button (utilizing the existing UI Button component) that navigates to the Contact page.

---

## 3. About Page

**File: src/app/about/page.tsx**  
- Create a page describing the company’s history, mission, and values with structured headers and paragraphs.  
- Optionally include a descriptive placeholder image (e.g., office or team meeting) with proper alt text and an onError fallback.

---

## 4. Products Page

**File: src/app/products/page.tsx**  
- Develop a grid layout showcasing various rice varieties using the Card component from the UI library.  
- Each card displays:  
  - A placeholder image (e.g., `https://placehold.co/400x300?text=Premium+rice+variety+display+in+elegant+card+layout`) with detailed alt text and onError handling.  
  - Product name and a brief description.  
- Ensure responsive design and proper spacing using Tailwind classes.

---

## 5. Contact Page

**File: src/app/contact/page.tsx**  
- Build a contact form page that contains fields for Name, Email, and Message.  
- Utilize or create a new reusable component (see next section) for the ContactForm.  
- Implement client-side validation (e.g., required fields, email format) and display error messages.  
- On successful submission, show a confirmation message; include error handling for submission failures.

---

## 6. New Component: Header

**File: src/components/Header.tsx**  
- Create a responsive navigation bar with site branding and links to Home, About, Products, and Contact (using Next.js Link).  
- Use Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern design without external icons.  
- Ensure proper accessibility (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).

---

## 7. New Component: Footer

**File: src/components/Footer.tsx**  
- Develop a simple footer with copyright details and additional textual links.  
- Style it consistently using Tailwind classes to match the overall design.

---

## 8. New Component: ContactForm

**File: src/components/ContactForm.tsx**  
- Build a reusable form component with input fields for Name, Email, and Message.  
- Integrate client-side validation and error handling, showing inline error messages as needed.  
- Use existing UI Button and Form components from the UI library for consistency.

---

# Summary

- Create a global layout (src/app/layout.tsx) to wrap pages with a Header and Footer.  
- Develop multi-page routing: Home (hero section), About, Products (using Card components), and Contact (with a validation-enabled form).  
- Build new Header and Footer components for navigation and site branding.  
- Create a dedicated ContactForm component with stateful validation and error handling.  
- Use Tailwind CSS for modern, clean styling and placeholder images with detailed URLs, alt texts, and onError handlers.  
- Ensure a responsive design, proper error management, and accessible navigation throughout the UI.

I will follow this plan thoroughly in my implementation and implement all the files in the plan.
